### Module Generator

This is a project created to make web development more simple, I think there are a lot of duplication in web development.
If we can abstract the common part as module and next time with some providing configuration file like(XML, YAML etc), we
can generate the certain module we will need in our project, like login module, register module, etc.

### Aspect considered:

#### Web
1. Login module
2. Register module

#### Persistence
1. Entity
2. Repository
3. Certain service

#### Frameworks
1. Spring
2. Symfony


### Technical usage
Scala
